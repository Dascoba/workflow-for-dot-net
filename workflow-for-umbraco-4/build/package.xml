Any failure to comply with the above or any other terms and conditions contained herein will result in the automatic termination of this license and the reversion of the rights granted hereunder to the Umbraco Deli Vendor.

5.  Disclaimer of Warranty. The Software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.   The Umbraco Deli Vendor and Umbraco I/S disclaims and makes no express or implied warranties and specifically disclaim the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement of third-party rights.

7.  Rental.  You may not loan, rent, or lease the SOFTWARE.

8.  Upgrades.  If the SOFTWARE is an upgrade from an earlier release or previously released version, you now may use that upgraded product only in accordance with this EULA.
